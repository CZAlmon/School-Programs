### Card Game Web Page

The objective was to create a ASP.NET:VB.NET web site under VS to play a “Pick a Card” game.

When first opened, the webpage would ask for your name, and a stake.

After clicking submit, you can input a wager and select a card. Clicking on the card image would input your selections.

If you won or lost, your result would be displayed, as +/- Wager, and the card chosen would be shown.

You name and current wager is kept in the cookies and retained for a set time frame so that if you came back to the page, you could pick up where you left off.

After your current stake hits 0, you cannot play anymore and must start a new game.
